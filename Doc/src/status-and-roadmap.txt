[section Status]
FParsec has been in development for several years and can now be considered "stable".

Version 0.9 is the last major release of FParsec before version 1.0.

Version 1.0 will be released once no bugs have been reported for a few weeks.

[note

Although FParsec has rather comprehensive unit tests (with code coverage close to 100% for many components), it likely still contains bugs. If you want to use FParsec in a production environment, you need to test your parsers thoroughly.

[section Future development]

There are no firm plans for any major new features yet.

One goal for the future development of FParsec is to support a more declarative syntax wherever possible.

If the [url "http://player.microsoftpdc.com/Session/04092962-4ed1-42c6-be07-203d42115274" type provider] language feature in the next version of F# will be powerful enough to implement some kind of typed regular expression (similar to the `printf`-syntax), that would certainly be an attractive feature to implement for FParsec.

In the longer term it would also be nice if FParsec could automatically optimize certain combined `Parser` functions, but that should ideally be done at compile time and F# currently doesn't have the meta-programming facilities for that.
