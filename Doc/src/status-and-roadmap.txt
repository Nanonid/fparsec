[section Status]
FParsec has been in development for several years and can now be considered "stable".

Version 1.0 of FParsec was released on 19 July 2012.

[note

Although FParsec has rather comprehensive unit tests (with code coverage close to 100% for many components), it likely still contains bugs. If you want to use FParsec in a production environment, you need to test your parsers thoroughly.

[section Future development]

There are no firm plans for any major new features yet.

One goal for the future development of FParsec is to support a more declarative parser definition syntax without compromising on FParsec's performance or language-integrated nature.

For example, it would be nice if FParsec provided a way to automatically create optimized lexer functions from a series of typed regular expressions and associated mapping functions, ideally at compile time. Using such a feature could maybe look similar to

``
let lexer : Parser<AstNode, 'u> = 
    lex ["regex-with-1-capture-group", (fun x -> AstNode1(x))
         "regex-with-2-capture-groups", (fun x y -> AstNode2(x, y))
         (* ... *)]
``
